   <h1>Welcome to Better Bike ABQ<br></h1>
   <left_col>
    <h3>So, where are the safest roads to ride a bike in Albuquerque?   <br>
     As a bicycle enthusiast it was my personal goal to answer this question.  It started as<br>
     a class project and grew into this website. What I discovered were the many areas of town <br>
     that bost a high incident of accidents.  The factors for these accidents are many, as it <br>
     is difficult to boil down the cause to just one factor.  This site hopes to highlight Danger<br>
      Zones in the ABQ metro area as well as to provide some sage advice for best practices for riding<br>
     in the city.  It is my hope to improve ridership as a whole and to keep both riders and drivers safe.  <br>
     Enjoy!
